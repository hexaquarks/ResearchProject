## Simulation and analysis of diffusion of cell membrane proteins in different confinement models.

### Note
This is my undergraduate research project that was done for PHYS 449 at McGill. It was in supervision of Dr. Paul Wiseman.

### The confinement models simulated are 
<ol type="a">
  <li>No confinement (free diffusion)</li>
  <li>Lattice of variable size (from underlying cytoskeleton of cell membrane)</li>
  <li>Transient diffusion in nanoscale circular domains </li>
</ol>
